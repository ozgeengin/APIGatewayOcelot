# Simple API Gateway with Ocelot

## This repo contains samples that help us to build API Gateway using Ocelot in .NET 6.

Ocelot is an open source framework used for building .NET core API gateways, the project is aimed at people using .NET / .NET Core to build applications designed with microservices or SOA architectures. Ocelot provides an easy way to write a mapping file (ocelot.json) that could be used to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate downstream services.
